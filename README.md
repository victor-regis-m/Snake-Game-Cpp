# Snake-Game-Cpp
A very cool and simple snake game which I used as a crash course to get better at some basic/intermetiate C++ concepts, and also to practice development using OOP clean code standards.

A snake game with the following features:
- Title - Game - End loop
- Score and highscore systems
- Music and sound effects

Credit to Chili for development of the Chili Framework and the files:
- Sounds.h and Sounds.cpp
- SoundEffects.h
- SpriteCodex.h and SpriteCodex.cpp (except for DrawScore, DrawNumber and ShowHighscore functions)
- All audio files and settings

A short video to show the game in execution:

(i believe that the framework and the windows game capture function make the window go to the top left location of the screen, sorry for that)
